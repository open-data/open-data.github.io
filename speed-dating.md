Are you passionate about using open data to create innovative solutions to economic, environmental or social problems?

Whether you're creating mobile apps or websites, or doing analysis and visualization, we know that finding and understanding Canadian and international open data can be a challenge.

The GTEC 2013 Open Data Speed Dating Event will provide the ideal match-making opportunity for Open Data curators and developers, with a focus on Canadian data. 

*Speed Data-ing*

Participants (developers and other open data enthusiasts) will be matched with up to 20 Open Data owners from Canadian federal, provincial/territorial and municipal governments for a series of rapid one-on-one conversations. Each conversation will be unique and defined by you. Discussions can range from opportunities to work more collaboratively on open data projects to exploring available data in greater detail and its potential uses or applications. This is also a great opportunity to talk to federal data owners and other open data enthusiasts to brainstorm on potential submissions to the **upcoming Canadian Open Data Everywhere (CODE) challenge**.

[GTEC](http://www.gtec.ca/) is an annual technology conference in Ottawa, Canada, that brings together leading public and private sector experts to collaborate on serving citizens better through innovation and technology.
